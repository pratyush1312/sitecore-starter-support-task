              My Five most favourite and five least favourite support tasks are as follow:- 
  
              5 Favoutite Tasks üòç <br></br>
  
              1. Manage a support team - I have a very interesting skill which is the leadership quality, I manage my team like we are building some kind of kingdom. While working in the past I have organised many hackathons with my team and the team management thing is something I love the most. Handling everyone listening to the idea and evolving every day this makes it my top favourite part of managing a team. <br></br>
  
              2. Scheduling time-off coverage and collaborating as part of a growing cohesive support team - There is a line which says ‚ÄúWe grow as a team, and we lose as a team‚Äù. No one is working alone or say is the only reason for any good or bad things. We as a team represent any product. Collaboration leads to many ideas and helps us grow as a team and this point is in my favourite list. <br></br>
  
              3. Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders - Everyone wants to know what is really happening, providing them with the updates will make a good impression and more confidence going forward. <br></br>
  
              4. Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use - Analyzing is the most important thing in the support, if you get to know that this feature is getting more amount of tickets we can pass the same information to the product team along with the feedback from the client. So that the product team can improve the feature or make it easy to use without the data neither we nor the product team can do anything. Analytics is the king. <br></br>
  
              5. Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case - While being in the support role I realised that some topics get the most amount of attention or say the most amount of tickets. Creating a video helping them understand the topic makes their life easier as not all of us want to read the lengthy documentation, video is the simplest way to make anyone understand. <br></br>
  
              <br></br><br></br>
  
              5 Least Favourite üò∂ <br></br>
  
              1. Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel - This may not sound interesting but I want to be available for most of the issue rather than focusing only on one. My moto is to provide the best client experience so that they can rely on our product in future <br></br>
  
              2. Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day - I want to respond to as many tickets as I want to but I don‚Äôt want to bind myself with the number. Again my simple motto is to help the client make their life easier <br></br>
  
              3. Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub - This is on my list not because I don‚Äôt like it but because this is something I like less. I want to and will resolve the bugs in the repos <br></br>
  
              4. Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion, to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems - I want to understand the pain of each customer and help them with the solutions, maybe in the public discussion they can‚Äôt open up and keep something to themselves. While being in touch with the client separately will help me understand him more closely and they can share their pain points without any worries <br></br>
  
              5. Help resolve billing issues for customers - As a support team member I want to understand their pain point help them with all the issues they are facing but billing is something I least like and I always want to redirect them to the billing department for resolutions rather than doing it myself.<br></br>
  
  
                These are my honest opinion based on my preferences. ‚úåÔ∏è

          <p className={`m-0 max-w-[30ch] text-sm opacity-50`}>
            From my past experiences, I want to grow this team and the product. I want to provide the best support to the client to make their experience awesome. <br></br>
  
  Support is not just about resolving tickets and going to bed after work, I get satisfied when the client says, ‚ÄúThis is something I was looking for‚Äù and this line makes a great difference between providing them the solution and helping them solve their pain.
  If my product can solve the pain point of the client I can help them all the way and this is what I want to learn and understand from all the interactions with the client.<br></br>
  
  I always want to provide the best to the best whether it is technical or it is non-technical, I want to excel both and combining both I want to grow and make the support team the best support one can ever have.

          <p className={`m-0 max-w-[30ch] text-sm opacity-50`}>
            When I was working as a support member at Whatfix, there was one client who was about to go live and he wanted me to stay on stand-by if they faced any issues. <br></br>
  
  I was not the one who solved their tickets, this was the first time I was handling their issue. <br></br>
  Once they were live in the product nothing was visible and everything was broken, all the codes and all the customisations. They started freaking out about the product and as a support member available I was the sole responsible for the answer.<br></br>
  
  I stood a step back and asked them what was the most important thing at this point in time and I will start from that part, they helped me with the most important thing which was the home page customisation and I started doing that. <br></br>
  In my mind, there was an image of solving each bit separately and resolving this issue like a Lego. <br></br>
  I spend 7 hrs on the call doing each thing separately. After everything was done all the changes were reflected in the production I felt like I did something which could help them save their product. <br></br>
  
  I realised one thing solve the issue like a Lego one at a time and do the best in each task (in each Lego) and you will end up resolving the issue without any hassle

  Choosing between Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, and Edge Middleware with Vercel depends on the specific needs of your application: <br></br>
  
  Edge Functions are ideal for scenarios where low latency is crucial. <br></br>
  Serverless Functions are suitable for server-side computations that don‚Äôt require the lowest possible latency. They can handle more complex logic and have a longer execution time compared to Edge Functions.<br></br>
  Edge Middleware runs before the Edge Network Cache, which makes it perfect for tasks like routing, experimentation, and personalization at the edge <br></br>
  
  In summary, we can use Edge Functions for high performance with low latency, Serverless Functions for more complex server-side logic, and Edge Middleware for dynamic routing and content personalization.

            Many times when I got on a call I was unaware about the tech and unaware about the error. As a support guy, you can‚Äôt back up from the call and you have to be there even if you don‚Äôt know the tech then and there. <br></br>
  
  My first approach is to understand their use case and the specific error that they are getting.<br></br>
  Once I have everything in hand, I will start asking some clarifying questions.<br></br>
  1. when did you start getting this error, were you trying to do something specific <br></br>
  2. What did you do till now to handle the errors (this will save my time to focus on other troubleshooting methods) <br></br>
  
  These questions will make the issue more clear in my mind. <br></br>
  
  While talking to the client I search for the related documentation which can help them with the issues.  <br></br>
  Once I have all the things and all the steps that they have done till now, I will ask them whether I can take the issue offline and work on it so that they don‚Äôt have to wait for me to resolve the issue. <br></br>
  When I get off the call, I will read the documentation or get help from the senior who might have faced a similar issue related to the tech. <br></br><br></br>
  
  This is my approach when I have 0 knowledge about the tech.

            Hi John, <br></br>

I know this can be frustrating, but rest assured I am looking into the issue. <br></br>
From our last conversation, I had all the error-related issues, and am working on it. There is some progress in the issue and I will share the same with you soon. <br></br>

I will make sure to get back to you ASAP with the resolution.<br></br>

Apologies for the delay here <br></br>

            Hi John, <br></br>
  
  Hope you are doing well!
  Thank you for reaching out to us
  
   To redirect from the /blog path to https://example.com, you can add a redirect configuration in your vercel.json file. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:
  
  Open your vercel.json file in the root directory of your project.
  Add the following redirect configuration:
  {/* {
    "redirects": [
      {
        "source": "/blog/:path*",
        "destination": "https://example.com/:path*",
        "permanent": true
      }
    ]
  } */}
  
  
  This configuration will redirect all requests from the /blog path to https://example.com, preserving the path structure. <br></br>
  
  
  If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.<br></br>
  
  
  Have a great day ahead!<br></br>
  
  
  Regards,
  
  <br><br></br></br>
  
  Decision-Making Process: Using the redirects configuration in the vercel.json file is a straightforward and efficient way to handle redirects on Vercel. In order to improve SEO, the permanent property is set to true to inform search engines and other services that the redirect is permanent. Furthermore, this method does not require any changes to the codebase and can be managed easily through the Vercel dashboard after deployment.

            Dear John, <br></br>
  
            hope you are doing well!
  
            To ensure your Vercel project is not indexed by search engines, you can add a robots.txt file to the root of your project with the following content:
  
            User-agent: *
            Disallow: /
  
  <br></br>
  This file will instruct search engines not to index any pages on your site.<br></br>
  {/* Additionally, you can add <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow"> to the <head> section of your HTML documents to further prevent indexing. */}
  
  Please note that these methods are respected by search engines but they dont provide a 100% gurantee that your page wont be indexed. <br></br>
  
  Let me know if you face any difficulties.<br></br>
  
  Have a good one ahead <br></br>
  Regards,
  
  
  
  
  I crafted this response in accordance with standard practices for preventing search engine indexing. An additional layer of instructions for page-level indexing preferences is provided by the robots.txt file and the meta tag. Most website owners can implement both methods without requiring extensive technical knowledge, making them accessible options. <br><br></br></br>

            One of the most common problems Vercel customers face is related to deployment issues, such as difficulties with configuration, domain setup, or integration with other services <br></br>

Short-term solutions: <br></br>

Immediate Support -  Provide step-by-step guides and troubleshooting documentation to help users resolve their issues quickly. <br></br>
Customer Service: Offer responsive customer service through live chat or a ticketing system to address urgent concerns. <br></br>

Long-term solutions:<br></br>
Educational Resources: Create comprehensive tutorials and a knowledge base to educate users on best practices and common pitfalls. <br></br>
Community Engagement: Create a community forum where users can share solutions and learn from each other‚Äôs experiences. <br></br>
Product Improvement: Continuously improve the platform based on user feedback to reduce the occurrence of common issues. <br></br>


It‚Äôs important to have a robust Support team that helps the client with the paint points they bring to the team. <br></br><br></br>

            I think the task was good to familiarise someone. We can add more scenarios based questions which will help us understand how the candidate thinks based on different scenarios. <br></br>
  
  The candidate can learn tech but one thing which is hard to learn is customer-facing skills, so testing them before hand with some scenarios baked questions will help us understand whether the customer-facing sill is there or not <br></br>
